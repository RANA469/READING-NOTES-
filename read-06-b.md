 ## the first vedio
 # how computers works
The computers include: 
Smartphones, Wearables, video games, PC and laptops

##all compures have:
1.input
2.storage
3.processing
4.output


 ## the second vedio
it is talk about the technology as one of the thing that helps people noadays
the computer works with (01) but today we dont use it dirctly 
there is wires and circutes inside the computers that have all the infomation 


how do we store information using electricity:
if we have awire it will contans on or off with one wire we can represent yes or no or any thig that have tow option
and this is called (bit) and it is the smallest unit the computer can store it 
if you use more wires you will have more bits which is called (binary system)

binary system which used just tow numbers which is it (0,1)


by using 8 wires we will store numbers between 0 to 255
text images sounds each one of them have ahuge number of data such as the sounds its ahuge sereis of vibrations in the air and it is like awaveform and each wave can show through number 

## :the third vedio
# how computers work circuits and logic 
it is consederd an art form you can reflect your ideas throuhg it by using curcits 
input and output are information have on and off in order to procces the information that in the computers using circuts 
#### it is take an electric signal and flips it 
so if you give it 1 it will give you zero and the negative so it is not the same (not)
*the curcuts can take diffirent signal and give you diffirant result 
it is give us 1 only when we have tow 1(and )
if we have tow curcits it will called  adder 1+1=10
and it can do many calcolations

in the past it was very huge like fridge and slow 
but today it became very small and faster becouse the distance is shorter 

## fourh vedio
### memory ,cpu,input,output 
each processs of them happend in different places 
example:
we input the letter b on the keyboard it will became 01 and ..cpu  will store it to the memory and the screen will out put it after ghange it 
and it can help us to communicate with the the world and when we have complicated process we will need more the power of the cpu 
## fifth vedio
hard ware : which contains circuts ,stuff,plugs,speakers,wires,chips

*HOW THE HARD WARE AND THE SOFT WARE WORK TOGOTHR*
THE CP IS THE MASTER WHICH IS CONTROL in all the partes  and inside it has smaller and more simple which is doing asepecifc tasks
it has 
1.math and logic circuts 
2.send and receive circuts
and it knows which one it will use and when 
the binary code is the most basic form of software
there are many languages for software like 
1.python
2.ruby
3.blockly
the operater system which is asystem have aspecial ability which allows him to control with the other programs

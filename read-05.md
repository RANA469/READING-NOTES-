individual elements

to most child elements because the value  is
inherited by child elements
#### Why use External Style Sheets?
1. All of your web pages can share
the same style sheet. This is
achieved by using the <link>
element on each HTML page of
your site to link to the same CSS
document. to not rebeit it in every page
2. If you want to make a
change to how your site appears,
you only need to edit the one
CSS file and all of your pages
will be updated. for example (altering ) can change the style for all<h1>
3.  The HTML code
will be easier to read and edit
because it does not have lots of
CSS rules in the same document.

##### Sometimes you might consider placing CSS rules in the same page as your HTML code
1. if you are creating asingle page put the rules in same file to keep every thing in one place 
2. If you have one page which
requires a few extra rules , you might consider using
CSS in the same page.
3. Most of the examples
